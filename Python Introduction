#Python Introduction:
First of all, what is Python? According to its creator, Guido van Rossum, Python is a:

“high-level programming language, and its core design philosophy is all about code readability and a syntax which allows 
programmers to express concepts in a few lines of code.”

For me, the first reason to learn Python was that it is, in fact, a beautiful programming language. It was really natural to code in it and express my thoughts.
